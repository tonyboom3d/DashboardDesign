Developer Preview

This API is subject to change. Bug fixes and new features will be released based on developer feedback throughout the preview period.

Retrieves a list of up to 100 products, given the provided filtering, sorting, and cursor paging.
Pass supported values to the `fields` array in the request to include those fields in the response.

To learn about working with _Query_ endpoints, see
[API Query Language](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/articles/getting-started/api-query-language),
and [Sorting and Paging](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/articles/getting-started/sorting-and-paging).

**Notes:**

- This method does not return `variantsInfo`. To retrieve product variants, use the Get Product method.
- To retrieve a non-visible product ( `visible: false`), your app must have the required `SCOPE.STORES.PRODUCT_READ_ADMIN` permission scope.
